Watashiwa **Arun S V** desu. Ahem, that's all the japanese I know. I'm building a college 
that I've always dreamt to study through [**Tiny Leap**](https://tinyleap.org). The notion 
is simple, as humans we are capable of learning and achieving anything by ourselves. We just 
need an environment with great curriculum, resources and tools, peer and mentor network and 
ample opportunities to take leverage.

Aside from being a founder, my casual life includes more **music** - the best art of the 
universe, **anime** - art from Japan, **cars / bikes** - the art that drives my adrenaline, 
etc.
