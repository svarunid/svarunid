### Hey There! ðŸ‘‹

____________

I'm a passionate ***Deep Learning Engineer*** and was previously a ***Junior Research 
Engineer @ Buddi AI***, worked on projects that automate tedious processes of the 
healthcare sector. I view everything man had ever made as an art, and hence I'm also 
an **Aesthete**. 
<br><br>
As my work is primarily related to AI, the rapid advancements had caused me **FOMO** and also
made me excited to be a part  of it. I believe *Artificial Intelligence* has immense potential to 
revolutionize our way of life. My goal is to bring  **AI to the local community while making it affordable** for every individual.
<br><br>
My casual life includes more **music** - the best art of the universe, **anime** - art 
from Japan, **cars / bikes** - the art that drives my adrenaline, etc. <br>
