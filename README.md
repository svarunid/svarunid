### Hey There! ðŸ‘‹

____________

I'm a ***Junior Research Engineer @ Buddi AI***, working on projects that automate <br>
tedious processes of the healthcare sector. I view everything man had ever made <br>
as an art, and hence I'm also an **Aesthete**. As my work is primarily related to AI, <br>
the rapid advancements had caused me FOMO and also made me excited to be a part  of <br>
it. 
<br><br>
My casual life includes more **music** - the best art of the universe, **anime** - art <br>
from Japan, **cars / bikes** - the art that drives my adrenaline, etc. <br>
